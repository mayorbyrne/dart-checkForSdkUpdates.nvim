# dart-sdk-updates.nvim

My VSCode friends using dart were being alerted of new releases of the sdk, thanks to the https://dartcode.org/docs/settings/#dartcheckforsdkupdates

I couldn't find anything in vim/nvim that would notify me about new Dart SDK releases, so I decided to create a plugin that would do just that. This is my first plugin, so please be gentle.

## TODO

- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] strengthen dart-sdk version detection
